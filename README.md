# Ve

Yet another Elixir data validation engine library.

Main goals: light and succintly.

PR are welcome. Documentation, usage and examples come soon...

## Installation

The package can be installed by adding `ve` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:ve, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```
